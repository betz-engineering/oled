# dev branch
the goal for now is cleaner low-level code

  * provide a stable API for reading inputs, setting LEDs, sending the framebuffer
  * support ui_board and ui_board_1u
  * provide a well defined hardware abstraction layer for porting to new hardware
  * support reading the inputs in polling or interrupt mode
  * demonstrate the library on SDL, picorv32, litex_obsidian, and marble_mmc

# Structure
The `cmod` directory contains the verilog code and firmware for an example design running on a Digilent CMODA7.

The `firmware` directory contains the `demo.c` code and some bitmap fonts for a simple demo application.

The `firmware/lib` directory contains the re-usable library code for interacting with the ui_board.

The `font` directory contains some font files in .ttf format and a python script to convert them to bitmap fonts usable by the library.

The code in the `sdl_sim` directory is intended to be compiled on a linux host with `make`. It allows to preview the demo code on a PC using the SDL2 library. There are no other external dependencies.

# OLED display driver for picorv32
Tested on [NHD-2.8-25664UCB2](http://www.newhavendisplay.com/specs/NHD-2.8-25664UCB2.pdf): 256 x 64 pixels, 16 shades.
Other displays with [ssd1322](https://www.newhavendisplay.com/app_notes/SSD1322.pdf#page=1&zoom=auto,-274,842) controller should also work.

This repo demonstrates the ssd1322 display driver on hardware (CMODA7). It's secondary use is to develop the GUI and GUI library for the AR analog chassis.

The actual re-usable library files are in `firmware/lib`. Everything else is just for demonstration / testing.

# Features
  * draw pixel
  * draw rectangle (outline or filled)
  * draw line (anti aliased)
  * draw text (anti aliased, variable or fixed width bitmap fonts, UTF-8 support, emojis!)

The font engine is a stripped down version of the one used in [LVGL](https://docs.lvgl.io/latest/en/html/overview/font.html).

Only 4 bit / pixel, no kerning, no compression, no bidirectional mode.

The LVGL [Font Converter](https://lvgl.io/tools/fontconverter) can be used to generate a `.c` file with custom font data.

# SDL simulation
The demo app can be previewed and developed on a PC using the [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library for graphics output. See `sdl_sim/test.c`.

See [`psu_board_gui.c`](https://gitlab.lbl.gov/llrf-projects/analog_chassis_firmware/-/blob/master/lib/psu_board_gui.c) for a practical example on how to use this library to draw a GUI.

# Hardware demo
See `cmod/synth` directory for a synthesizable demo which runs on the Cmod A7 + [ui_board](https://gitlab.lbl.gov/llrf-projects/analog_psu_board#25w230-ui_board).

It demonstrates drawing to the display, setting the LED color and reading the rotary encoder.

This assumes the ui_board is directly, __without cable__, plugged into the Cmod A7 PMOD header.
